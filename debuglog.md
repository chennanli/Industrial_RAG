# Debug Log

## Changes Made to combined_tabbed.py

- Added functionality to select between HuggingFace and LM Studio model sources via radio buttons.
- Implemented a dynamic dropdown for LM Studio models that populates with models available from the LM Studio API (`/v1/models`).
- Created a `generate_response` abstraction function to route model calls based on the selected source.
- Added checks in image and video processing functions to prevent multimodal analysis when LM Studio (text-only) is selected.
- Fixed duplicated code and an incomplete `try` block in the `process_video_with_rag` function.
- Updated `requirements.txt` to include the `openai` library.

## Encountered Error

When attempting to run `python combined_tabbed.py` after selecting "LMStudio" as the model source, the application failed to connect to the LM Studio server.

**Error Message:**
```
httpcore.ConnectError: [Errno 61] Connection refused
...
openai.APIConnectionError: Connection error.
```

**Diagnosis:**
This error indicates that the Python script was unable to establish a connection to the LM Studio server at the configured address (`http://localhost:1234/v1`). This is likely due to the LM Studio server not running or not having a model loaded and actively serving requests on that port.

**Action Required:**
To resolve this, ensure your LM Studio application is running, the local server is started, and the desired model is loaded within LM Studio. Once confirmed, restart the Python application.
