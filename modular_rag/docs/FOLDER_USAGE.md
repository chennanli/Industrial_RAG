# Directory Usage Guide

This document explains the purpose and usage of various directories in the system.

## Essential Directories

### `RAG_pdf/`
- **Purpose**: Stores PDF documents for the RAG knowledge base.
- **Usage**: Place your technical PDF documents here before processing the knowledge base.
- **GitHub**: The directory structure is kept, but PDF files are not tracked by Git.

### `frame_cache/`
- **Purpose**: Caches extracted video frames to avoid redundant processing.
- **Usage**: System will automatically create and manage this folder.
- **GitHub**: The directory structure is kept, but the cached frames are not tracked by Git.

### `saved_frames/`
- **Purpose**: Storage for important extracted video frames that need to be preserved.
- **Usage**: The system may save specific frames here for visualization or debugging.
- **GitHub**: The directory structure is kept, but the saved frames are not tracked by Git.

## Utility Directories

### `offload_folder/`
- **Purpose**: Used for model weight offloading to reduce memory usage.
- **Usage**: The system uses this folder to temporarily store model weights that are not immediately needed during inference. This helps reduce GPU/RAM memory usage for large models.
- **Details**: This technique is especially helpful when running large models on systems with limited memory. The system will automatically load weights from this folder when needed and offload them when not in use.
- **GitHub**: The directory structure is kept, but the offloaded weight files are not tracked by Git.

### `temp_backup/`
- **Purpose**: Stores temporary backups created during code or data processing.
- **Usage**: The system creates temporary backups here during operations that might need to be rolled back.
- **Details**: Used primarily during PDF indexing or other operations where interim results need to be preserved in case of failures.
- **GitHub**: The directory structure is kept, but the backup files are not tracked by Git.

## Ignored Directories

### `archieved/`
- **Purpose**: Contains old, deprecated code and files no longer in use.
- **Usage**: This directory is for personal organization only - a place to move files that are no longer needed but you don't want to delete permanently.
- **GitHub**: This directory is completely ignored by Git and won't appear in the repository.

### `__pycache__/`
- **Purpose**: Contains Python bytecode cache files.
- **Usage**: Automatically generated by Python interpreter.
- **GitHub**: These directories are completely ignored by Git and won't appear in the repository.

## Managing Directories

- Use the `.gitignore` file to control which directories and files are tracked by Git.
- The `.gitkeep` files are used to preserve directory structure in Git when the directory is otherwise empty.
- Feel free to delete the contents of `temp_backup/` and `offload_folder/` when not in use, but keep the directories themselves.
