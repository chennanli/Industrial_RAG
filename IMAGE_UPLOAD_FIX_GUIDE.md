# Image/Video Upload Not Working with LM Studio - Fix Guide

## Problem Explanation
When you switch to LM Studio, the image and video upload fields become disabled (grayed out and unclickable). This is intentional behavior because LM Studio only supports text processing, not images or videos.

## Why This Happens
LM Studio models are text-only models that cannot process images or videos. Your application is designed to disable these features when LM Studio is selected to prevent errors.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Better User Experience (Recommended)
Improve the UX by making it clear why the fields are disabled:

```bash
cd /Users/chennanli/Desktop/LLM_Project/Qwen2.5
python fix_image_upload.py
```

This will:
- Add status messages explaining why uploads are disabled
- Show placeholders in the disabled fields
- Keep the behavior correct but more user-friendly

### Option 2: Create Hybrid Mode
Enable a hybrid mode where image analysis uses HuggingFace but text uses LM Studio:

```bash
cd /Users/chennanli/Desktop/LLM_Project/Qwen2.5
python hybrid_fix.py
```

This will:
- Keep image/video uploads enabled
- Use HuggingFace automatically for image processing
- Use LM Studio for final text generation
- Create the best of both worlds

### Option 3: Simple Re-enable (Not Recommended)
Simply make the fields clickable again without proper handling:

```bash
cd /Users/chennanli/Desktop/LLM_Project/Qwen2.5
python simple_fix.py
```

⚠️ Warning: This will cause errors if users upload images/videos while LM Studio is selected.

## Understanding the Behavior

1. **HuggingFace Mode**: All features work (text, image, video)
2. **LM Studio Mode**: Only text processing works

## Manual Fix (Advanced)
If you prefer to fix it manually:

1. Open `combined_tabbed.py`
2. Find the `update_model_source_selection` function
3. Change this line:
   ```python
   vision_interactive = False # Disable vision inputs
   ```
   To:
   ```python
   vision_interactive = True # Re-enable vision inputs
   ```

## Recommendation
- Use **Option 1** if you want proper user feedback
- Use **Option 2** if you want full functionality
- Avoid **Option 3** unless you understand the implications

## Testing
After applying any fix:
1. Restart your application
2. Switch to LM Studio
3. Try uploading an image/video
4. Check if it behaves as expected
